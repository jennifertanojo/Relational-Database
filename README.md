# Relational Database Project

**A Brief Project Description:**

*a) Domain of the application*

The domain of the application is food journaling and restaurant interaction, combining elements of personal food documentation, restaurant review and waitlist platforms, and online food services. 

*b) Aspects of the domain modeled by the database*

The applicationâ€™s goal is to serve as a comprehensive food experience platform, where users can not only document their food experiences but also interact with other users and restaurants in various ways. This project is best understood as a personal food journaling and interaction platform, where users can not only document and share their dining experiences but also have restaurant-related activities in ways that enhance their journaling: leaving reviews, creating a food bucket list, ordering food online, and joining a waitlist for dine-in.
